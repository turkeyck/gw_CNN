# gw_final_report
This repository shows how to use pycbc package to generate gravitational wave data from compact binary black holes. We then apply CNN architecture to do GW detection and parameter estimation.

The full datasets used in this code is placed in my kaggle account (https://www.kaggle.com/jhihronglu/testdata).
